Here are the detailed steps to automate installation of Self hosted Integration Runtime on Azure VM's

1. **Create Self hosted Integration runtime configuration within Azure data factory**: Please run the **adfshirdeploy.sh** script to configure Self hosted Integration runtime within the specified Azure Data Factory. It deploys the *adf-template.json* and the corresponding parameter file *adf-template.parameters.json*. Please provide the existing Azure Data factory name as one of the input parameters. If you havent created data factory yet, please go to the folder data-factory where you can find the scripts to create a brand new datafactory with or without CI\CD integration.


2. **Create a Windows VM which will act as the Self hosted Integration runtime node:** Please run the **windowsvmdeploy.sh** to deploy the Self hosted integration runtime VM within the specified Virtual network\subnet. As part of this deployment it will deploy the ARM template *vm-windows.json*  , we will also install and configure the Integration runtime software as part of the custom script extension. Please note that you need to provide the **datafactory name** and **self hosted integration runtime name** specified in the above step as input parameters within the *vm-windows.parameters.json* file. You can rerun this step upto 4 times to create upto 4 nodes for Self hosted integration runtime which can provide high availability,resiliency and scalability etc
